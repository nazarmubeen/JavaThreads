Java has preconfigured thread pool implementations that can be instantiated using the factory methods of the Executors class. The important ones are listed below:

    newFixedThreadPool: This type of pool has a fixed number of threads and any number of tasks can be submitted for execution. Once a thead finishes a task, it can reused to execute another task from the queue.

    newSingleThreadExecutor: This executor uses a single worker thread to take tasks off of queue and execute them. If the thread dies unexpectedly, then the executor will replace it with a new one.

    newCachedThreadPool: This pool will create new threads as required and use older ones when they become available. However, it'll terminate threads that remain idle for a certain configurable period of time to conserve memory. This pool can be a good choice for short-lived asynchronous tasks.

    newScheduledThreadPool: This pool can be used to execute tasks periodically or after a delay.
